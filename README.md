## Introduction

This documentation explains the concept of Monorepo with a detailed overview of features, use cases, workflows, and best practices for efficient repository management.

---

## What is Monorepo

A **monorepo** (monolithic repository) is a strategy where multiple projects, applications, or services reside within a single version-controlled repository. This promotes unified workflows, shared dependencies, and better team collaboration.

---

## Why Use Monorepo

* **Centralized Codebase**: All code in one place for easy discovery.
* **Efficient Collaboration**: Seamless development across multiple teams.
* **Unified Tooling**: Shared testing, building, and linting configurations.
* **Cross-Project Visibility**: Track and test the impact of changes across projects.

---

## Features

* Single repository for multiple applications/libraries
* Shared modules and utilities
* Unified dependency and version management
* Common build and deploy pipelines
* Tools support (Nx, Lerna, Bazel, Yarn Workspaces)

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

| Feature               | Description                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Code Reusability      | Shared components reduce duplication       |
| Simplified Management | Easier to update, refactor, and maintain   |
| Faster Onboarding     | Developers work from one central place     |
| Atomic Commits        | Single commit can span multiple apps/libs  |
| Better Testing        | Run cross-project or isolated tests easily |

### Disadvantages

| Limitation         | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Scalability        | May become slow as repo size increases                |
| Complex CI/CD      | Advanced configuration needed for large monorepos     |
| Merge Conflicts    | More likely due to centralized commits                |
| Access Control     | Hard to enforce permissions per project               |
| Tooling Dependency | Requires tooling like Nx, Bazel, Lerna for efficiency |

## Monorepo Workflow

| Step                | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Plan Structure   | Organize code into apps/, libs/, packages/                          |
| 2. Select Tools     | Pick tooling: Nx, Lerna, Rush, Yarn Workspaces                      |
| 3. CI/CD Setup      | Implement pipelines with affected-only builds and tests             |
| 4. Code Sharing     | Use shared modules and enforce dependency boundaries                |
| 5. Targeted Testing | Run tests only on changed or affected modules                       |
| 6. Deployment       | Deploy per-project or batch-deploy depending on system architecture |

## Best Practices

| Practice                  | Description                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Use Modular Architecture  | Split logic across clearly defined domains           |
| Define Clear Boundaries   | Prevent cross-project leaks using lint rules         |
| Incremental Builds        | Build/test only what changed using dependency graphs |
| Optimize CI/CD            | Use caching, concurrency, and affected-logic         |
| Maintain Documentation    | Per project/module documentation in the repo         |
| Automate Lint/Test/Format | Use pre-commit hooks and automated checks            |
| Update Dependencies       | Use central version policies, keep them fresh        |
| Monitor Performance       | Watch repo performance as it scales                  |

---

## Conclusion

Monorepos streamline code collaboration, versioning, and automation when implemented correctly. Their success depends on scalable tooling, consistent structure, and proactive maintenance.
