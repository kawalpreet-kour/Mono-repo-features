## Introduction

This documentation explains the concept of Monorepo with a detailed overview of features, use cases, workflows, and best practices for efficient repository management.

---

## What is Monorepo

A **monorepo** (monolithic repository) is a strategy where multiple projects, applications, or services reside within a single version-controlled repository. This promotes unified workflows, shared dependencies, and better team collaboration.

---

## Why Use Monorepo

- **Centralized Codebase**: All apps, libraries, and shared components live in one place, making it easy to trace, maintain, and discover code.
- **Efficient Collaboration**: Developers work together more easily with unified access, faster code sharing, and reduced duplication.
- **Unified Tooling**: Shared testing, building, and linting configurations apply across all projects, reducing maintenance overhead.
- **Cross-Project Visibility**: Track and test the impact of changes across multiple projects or services seamlessly.

## Features


| Core Areas                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Repository for Multiple Projects**    | Host multiple applications, libraries, or services within a single repository to simplify code access and collaboration.                                       |
| **Shared Modules and Utilities**               | Share common code (e.g., utilities, interfaces, components) across projects to reduce duplication and ensure consistency.                                      |
| **Unified Dependency and Version Management**  | Manage all dependencies centrally with synchronized versioning for packages using tools like Yarn Workspaces or Lerna.                                         |
| **Centralized Build and Deployment Pipelines** | Standardize and streamline CI/CD processes across all projects for faster, consistent releases.                                                                |
| **Tooling Support**                            | Leverage monorepo-compatible tools like **Nx**, **Bazel**, **Lerna**, or **Yarn Workspaces** to automate tasks, manage dependencies, and optimize performance. |
| **Consistent Developer Experience**            | Enforce uniform standards across projects (e.g., linters, testing setup, folder structure), reducing onboarding time.                                          |
| **Code Refactoring at Scale**                  | Apply sweeping changes (e.g., API updates or fixes) across all projects with minimal risk.                                                                     |
| **Atomic Commits and Visibility**              | Changes affecting multiple packages can be tracked and versioned together, improving traceability and coordination.                                            |

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages


| Advantage Area           | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Reusability**     | Reduce duplication by reusing shared components and modules.  |
| **Simplified Management**| Easier to maintain, refactor, and update all projects centrally. |
| **Faster Onboarding**    | Developers can start quickly with a single, unified repo.     |
| **Atomic Commits**       | Make consistent changes across multiple projects in one go.   |
| **Better Testing**       | Run both cross-project and isolated tests more effectively.   |

---

### Disadvantages


| Limitation               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability Issues**   | Performance may degrade as repo size and project count increase.            |
| **Complex CI/CD**        | Requires well-planned pipelines to manage dependencies and triggers.        |
| **Merge Conflicts**      | Higher chance of conflicts when multiple teams commit to shared files.      |
| **Access Control Limits**| Difficult to apply fine-grained permissions within a single repo.           |
| **Tooling Overhead**     | Needs tools like Nx, Bazel, or Lerna to handle large monorepo efficiently.  |

## Monorepo Workflow



| Step                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Developers Work**   | Multiple developers contribute code to the same monorepo repository.        |
| **Central Repository**| All projects (frontend, backend, etc.) are stored in one unified repository.|
| **Structured Folders**| The codebase is divided into folders based on projects or services.         |
| **Shared Library**    | A centralized library contains reusable code used by multiple projects.     |
| **Code Reuse**        | Projects/folders reuse the shared code to maintain consistency and avoid duplication. |

## FAQ

1. **Is a monorepo suitable for every organization?**  
   Not always. Monorepos work best for teams with shared dependencies, close collaboration, or a strong need for centralized workflows. Large organizations with many independent teams may prefer polyrepos for isolation.

2. **Which tools should I use to manage a monorepo efficiently?**  
   Tools like **Nx**, **Bazel**, **Yarn Workspaces**, and **Lerna** help manage builds, dependencies, and code structure in monorepos. The choice depends on the tech stack, team size, and scale.

3. **How do I avoid performance issues as the monorepo grows?**  
   Use **incremental builds**, **affected-only testing**, **dependency graphs**, and **caching** in CI/CD pipelines. Also, monitor repo performance regularly and archive or isolate stale code when possible.

## Conclusion

Monorepos streamline code collaboration, versioning, and automation when implemented correctly. Their success depends on scalable tooling, consistent structure, and proactive maintenance.
